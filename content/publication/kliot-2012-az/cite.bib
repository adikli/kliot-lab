 abstract = {Insects are exposed to a variety of stress factors in their
environment, and, in many cases for insect pests to agriculture,
those factors include toxic chemical insecticides. Coping with
the toxicity of insecticides can be costly and requires energy
and resource allocation for adaptation and survival. Several
behavioural, physiological and genetic mechanisms are used by
insects to handle toxic insecticides, sometimes leading to
resistance by constitutive overexpression of detoxification
enzymes or inducing mutations in the target sites. Such actions
are costly and may affect reproduction, impair dispersal ability
and have several other effects on the insect's fitness. Fitness
costs resulting from resistance to insecticides has been reported
in many insects from different orders, and several examples are
given in this mini-review.},
