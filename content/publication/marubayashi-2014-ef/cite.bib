 abstract = {Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are sap-sucking insect pests,
and some cause serious damage in agricultural crops by direct
feeding and by transmitting plant viruses. Whiteflies maintain
close associations with bacterial endosymbionts that can
significantly influence their biology. All whitefly species
harbor a primary endosymbiont, and a diverse array of secondary
endosymbionts. In this study, we surveyed 34 whitefly populations
collected from the states of Sao Paulo, Bahia, Minas Gerais and
Parana in Brazil, for species identification and for infection
with secondary endosymbionts. Sequencing the mitochondrial
Cytochrome Oxidase I gene revealed the existence of five whitefly
species: The sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci B biotype
(recently termed Middle East-Asia Minor 1 or MEAM1), the
greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, B. tabaci A
biotype (recently termed New World 2 or NW2) collected only from
Euphorbia, the Acacia whitefly Tetraleurodes acaciae and Bemisia
tuberculata both were detected only on cassava. Sequencing rRNA
genes showed that Hamiltonella and Rickettsia were highly
prevalent in all MEAM1 populations, while Cardinium was close to
fixation in only three populations. Surprisingly, some MEAM1
individuals and one NW2 population were infected with Fritschea.
Arsenopnohus was the only endosymbiont detected in T.
vaporariorum. In T. acaciae and B. tuberculata populations
collected from cassava, Wolbachia was fixed in B. tuberculata and
was highly prevalent in T. acaciae. Interestingly, while B.
tuberculata was additionally infected with Arsenophonus, T.
acaciae was infected with Cardinium and Fritschea. Fluorescence
in situ hybridization analysis on representative individuals
showed that Hamiltonella, Arsenopnohus and Fritschea were
localized inside the bacteriome, Cardinium and Wolbachia
exhibited dual localization patterns inside and outside the
bacteriome, and Rickettsia showed strict localization outside the
bacteriome. This study is the first survey of whitely populations
collected in Brazil, and provides further insights into the
complexity of infection with secondary endosymionts in
whiteflies.},
