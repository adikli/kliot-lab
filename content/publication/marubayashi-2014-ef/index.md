abstract: 'Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are sap-sucking insect pests, and some
  cause serious damage in agricultural crops by direct feeding and by transmitting
  plant viruses. Whiteflies maintain close associations with bacterial endosymbionts
  that can significantly influence their biology. All whitefly species harbor a primary
  endosymbiont, and a diverse array of secondary endosymbionts. In this study, we
  surveyed 34 whitefly populations collected from the states of Sao Paulo, Bahia,
  Minas Gerais and Parana in Brazil, for species identification and for infection
  with secondary endosymbionts. Sequencing the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I
  gene revealed the existence of five whitefly species: The sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia
  tabaci B biotype (recently termed Middle East-Asia Minor 1 or MEAM1), the greenhouse
  whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, B. tabaci A biotype (recently termed New World
  2 or NW2) collected only from Euphorbia, the Acacia whitefly Tetraleurodes acaciae
  and Bemisia tuberculata both were detected only on cassava. Sequencing rRNA genes
  showed that Hamiltonella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent in all MEAM1 populations,
  while Cardinium was close to fixation in only three populations. Surprisingly, some
  MEAM1 individuals and one NW2 population were infected with Fritschea. Arsenopnohus
  was the only endosymbiont detected in T. vaporariorum. In T. acaciae and B. tuberculata
  populations collected from cassava, Wolbachia was fixed in B. tuberculata and was
  highly prevalent in T. acaciae. Interestingly, while B. tuberculata was additionally
  infected with Arsenophonus, T. acaciae was infected with Cardinium and Fritschea.
  Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on representative individuals showed
  that Hamiltonella, Arsenopnohus and Fritschea were localized inside the bacteriome,
  Cardinium and Wolbachia exhibited dual localization patterns inside and outside
  the bacteriome, and Rickettsia showed strict localization outside the bacteriome.
  This study is the first survey of whitely populations collected in Brazil, and provides
  further insights into the complexity of infection with secondary endosymionts in
  whiteflies.'
