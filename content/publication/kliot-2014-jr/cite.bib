 abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a name given to a
variety of techniques commonly used for visualizing gene
transcripts in eukaryotic cells and can be further modified to
visualize other components in the cell such as infection with
viruses and bacteria. Spatial localization and visualization of
viruses and bacteria during the infection process is an
essential step that complements expression profiling experiments
such as microarrays and RNAseq in response to different stimuli.
Understanding the spatiotemporal infections with these agents
complements biological experiments aimed at understanding their
interaction with cellular components. Several techniques for
visualizing viruses and bacteria such as reporter gene systems
or immunohistochemical methods are time-consuming, and some are
limited to work with model organisms and involve complex
methodologies. FISH that targets RNA or DNA species in the cell
is a relatively easy and fast method for studying spatiotemporal
localization of genes and for diagnostic purposes. This method
can be robust and relatively easy to implement when the
protocols employ short hybridizing, commercially-purchased
probes, which are not expensive. This is particularly robust
when sample preparation, fixation, hybridization, and
microscopic visualization do not involve complex steps. Here we
describe a protocol for localization of bacteria and viruses in
insect and plant tissues. The method is based on simple
preparation, fixation, and hybridization of insect whole mounts
and dissected organs or hand-made plant sections, with 20 base
pairs short DNA probes conjugated to fluorescent dyes on their
5' or 3' ends. This protocol has been successfully applied to a
number of insect and plant tissues, and can be used to analyze
expression of mRNAs or other RNA or DNA species in the cell.},
