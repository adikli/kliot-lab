abstract: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a name given to a variety of
  techniques commonly used for visualizing gene transcripts in eukaryotic cells and
  can be further modified to visualize other components in the cell such as infection
  with viruses and bacteria. Spatial localization and visualization of viruses and
  bacteria during the infection process is an essential step that complements expression
  profiling experiments such as microarrays and RNAseq in response to different stimuli.
  Understanding the spatiotemporal infections with these agents complements biological
  experiments aimed at understanding their interaction with cellular components. Several
  techniques for visualizing viruses and bacteria such as reporter gene systems or
  immunohistochemical methods are time-consuming, and some are limited to work with
  model organisms and involve complex methodologies. FISH that targets RNA or DNA
  species in the cell is a relatively easy and fast method for studying spatiotemporal
  localization of genes and for diagnostic purposes. This method can be robust and
  relatively easy to implement when the protocols employ short hybridizing, commercially-purchased
  probes, which are not expensive. This is particularly robust when sample preparation,
  fixation, hybridization, and microscopic visualization do not involve complex steps.
  Here we describe a protocol for localization of bacteria and viruses in insect and
  plant tissues. The method is based on simple preparation, fixation, and hybridization
  of insect whole mounts and dissected organs or hand-made plant sections, with 20
  base pairs short DNA probes conjugated to fluorescent dyes on their 5' or 3' ends.
  This protocol has been successfully applied to a number of insect and plant tissues,
  and can be used to analyze expression of mRNAs or other RNA or DNA species in the
  cell.
