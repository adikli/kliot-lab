 abstract = {We have recently shown that Rickettsia, a secondary facultative
bacterial symbiont that infects the whitefly B. tabaci is
implicated in the transmission of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV). Infection with Rickettsia improved the acquisition and
transmission of the virus by B. tabaci adults. Here we performed
a transcriptomic analysis with Rickettsia-infected and uninfected
B. tabaci adults before and after TYLCV acquisition. The results
show a dramatic and specific activation of the immune system in
the presence of Rickettsia before TYLCV acquisition. However,
when TYLCV was acquired, it induced massive activation of gene
expression in the Rickettsia uninfected population, whereas in
the Rickettsia-infected population the virus induced massive
down-regulation of gene expression. Fitness and choice
experiments revealed that while Rickettsia-infected whiteflies
are always more attracted to TYLCV-infected plants, this
attraction is not always beneficiary for their offspring. These
studies further confirm the role of Rickettsia in many aspects of
B. tabaci interactions with TYLCV, and possibly serves as an
important factor in the dissemination of the virus.},
