abstract: We have recently shown that Rickettsia, a secondary facultative bacterial
  symbiont that infects the whitefly B. tabaci is implicated in the transmission of
  Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Infection with Rickettsia improved the acquisition
  and transmission of the virus by B. tabaci adults. Here we performed a transcriptomic
  analysis with Rickettsia-infected and uninfected B. tabaci adults before and after
  TYLCV acquisition. The results show a dramatic and specific activation of the immune
  system in the presence of Rickettsia before TYLCV acquisition. However, when TYLCV
  was acquired, it induced massive activation of gene expression in the Rickettsia
  uninfected population, whereas in the Rickettsia-infected population the virus induced
  massive down-regulation of gene expression. Fitness and choice experiments revealed
  that while Rickettsia-infected whiteflies are always more attracted to TYLCV-infected
  plants, this attraction is not always beneficiary for their offspring. These studies
  further confirm the role of Rickettsia in many aspects of B. tabaci interactions
  with TYLCV, and possibly serves as an important factor in the dissemination of the
  virus.
