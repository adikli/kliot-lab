 abstract = {Abstract Most social species outbreed. However, some have
persistent inbreeding with occasional outbreeding, and the
decision of the individual regarding whether to stay in the
natal group and inbreed or to disperse, with the potential to
outbreed, is flexible and may depend on social, genetic and
ecological benefits and costs. Few of these factors have been
investigated experimentally in these systems. The beetle
Coccotrypes dactyliperda Fabricius, 1801 (Scolytidae:
Xyloborinae) lives in extended family colonies inside date
seeds. The beetles inbreed, but some individuals disperse away
from the natal seed and may outbreed. We investigated dispersal
behaviour and assessed fitness-related measures in inbred and
outbred offspring, in addition to the relative abundance of two
endosymbionts. We predicted inbred offspring to have higher
fitness-related measures and a reduced tendency to disperse than
outbred offspring, owing to fitness benefits of cooperation
within the colony, whereas increased endosymbiont abundance will
promote dispersal of their hosts, thus enhancing their own
spread in the population. Dispersing beetles were more active
than ones that remained in the natal seed. As predicted, fewer
inbred offspring dispersed than outbred offspring, but they
matured and dispersed earlier. Fitness-related measures of
inbred mothers were either lower (number of offspring) or not
different (body mass) from those of outbred mothers. Inbred
dispersers had greater amounts of Wolbachia, suggesting a role
in dispersal. The results support the hypothesis that inbred
females reduce dispersal and that early maturation and dispersal
are likely to be benefits of increased cooperation in brood
care.},
