abstract: 'Abstract Most social species outbreed. However, some have persistent inbreeding
  with occasional outbreeding, and the decision of the individual regarding whether
  to stay in the natal group and inbreed or to disperse, with the potential to outbreed,
  is flexible and may depend on social, genetic and ecological benefits and costs.
  Few of these factors have been investigated experimentally in these systems. The
  beetle Coccotrypes dactyliperda Fabricius, 1801 (Scolytidae: Xyloborinae) lives
  in extended family colonies inside date seeds. The beetles inbreed, but some individuals
  disperse away from the natal seed and may outbreed. We investigated dispersal behaviour
  and assessed fitness-related measures in inbred and outbred offspring, in addition
  to the relative abundance of two endosymbionts. We predicted inbred offspring to
  have higher fitness-related measures and a reduced tendency to disperse than outbred
  offspring, owing to fitness benefits of cooperation within the colony, whereas increased
  endosymbiont abundance will promote dispersal of their hosts, thus enhancing their
  own spread in the population. Dispersing beetles were more active than ones that
  remained in the natal seed. As predicted, fewer inbred offspring dispersed than
  outbred offspring, but they matured and dispersed earlier. Fitness-related measures
  of inbred mothers were either lower (number of offspring) or not different (body
  mass) from those of outbred mothers. Inbred dispersers had greater amounts of Wolbachia,
  suggesting a role in dispersal. The results support the hypothesis that inbred females
  reduce dispersal and that early maturation and dispersal are likely to be benefits
  of increased cooperation in brood care.'
