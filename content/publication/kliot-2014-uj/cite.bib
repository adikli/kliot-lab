 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plant defensive metabolites such as nicotine can
provide barriers to host-range expansion by generalist
herbivores. Nicotine is one of the most abundant and toxic plant
secondary metabolites in nature and is defined by high toxicity
to plant-feeding insects. There is significant variation in
nicotine tolerance among Bemisia tabaci (tobacco whitefly)
isolates. Some nicotine-tolerant B. tabaci strains can consume
40-fold higher nicotine levels than susceptible strains, and
also show cross-resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides. In
this study, biological and molecular assays were used to
investigate the responses of B. tabaci strains that differ in
their ability to tolerate dietary nicotine. RESULTS: Egg laying
and honeydew secretion bioassays as well as gene expression
microarrays were used to measure B. tabaci biological parameters
and gene transcripts misregulated in response to nicotine in
resistant and susceptible strains. The resistant B. tabaci
strain laid significantly fewer eggs and excreted more honeydew
on a tobacco strain with high levels of nicotine, suggesting a
fitness cost effect. The molecular response was drastic in the
susceptible strain, while the resistant strain exhibited
moderate response. Higher expression of the previously
identified CYP6CM1 P450 monooxygenase gene related to the
resistance to neonicotinoids, as well as other P450s and
metabolic genes, was identified in the resistant and susceptible
strains after exposure to nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine is a
very toxic plant natural compound, and its mode of action
resembles that of synthetic neonicotinoids. The biological and
molecular responses observed in this study suggest that nicotine
may play an important role in providing barriers for host-plant
expansion by generalists, and may act as a natural factor that
contributes to the development of insect populations resistant
to synthetic pesticides.},
