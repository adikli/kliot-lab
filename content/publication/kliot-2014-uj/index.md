abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Plant defensive metabolites such as nicotine can provide barriers
  to host-range expansion by generalist herbivores. Nicotine is one of the most abundant
  and toxic plant secondary metabolites in nature and is defined by high toxicity
  to plant-feeding insects. There is significant variation in nicotine tolerance among
  Bemisia tabaci (tobacco whitefly) isolates. Some nicotine-tolerant B. tabaci strains
  can consume 40-fold higher nicotine levels than susceptible strains, and also show
  cross-resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides. In this study, biological and molecular
  assays were used to investigate the responses of B. tabaci strains that differ in
  their ability to tolerate dietary nicotine. RESULTS: Egg laying and honeydew secretion
  bioassays as well as gene expression microarrays were used to measure B. tabaci
  biological parameters and gene transcripts misregulated in response to nicotine
  in resistant and susceptible strains. The resistant B. tabaci strain laid significantly
  fewer eggs and excreted more honeydew on a tobacco strain with high levels of nicotine,
  suggesting a fitness cost effect. The molecular response was drastic in the susceptible
  strain, while the resistant strain exhibited moderate response. Higher expression
  of the previously identified CYP6CM1 P450 monooxygenase gene related to the resistance
  to neonicotinoids, as well as other P450s and metabolic genes, was identified in
  the resistant and susceptible strains after exposure to nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine
  is a very toxic plant natural compound, and its mode of action resembles that of
  synthetic neonicotinoids. The biological and molecular responses observed in this
  study suggest that nicotine may play an important role in providing barriers for
  host-plant expansion by generalists, and may act as a natural factor that contributes
  to the development of insect populations resistant to synthetic pesticides.'
