 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many plant viruses are vector-borne and depend on
arthropods for transmission between host plants. Begomoviruses,
the largest, most damaging and emerging group of plant viruses,
infect hundreds of plant species, and new virus species of the
group are discovered each year. Begomoviruses are transmitted by
members of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci species complex in a
persistent-circulative manner. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV) is one of the most devastating begomoviruses worldwide
and causes major losses in tomato crops, as well as in many
agriculturally important plant species. Different B. tabaci
populations vary in their virus transmission abilities; however,
the causes for these variations are attributed among others to
genetic differences among vector populations, as well as to
differences in the bacterial symbionts housed within B. tabaci.
RESULTS: Here, we performed discovery proteomic analyses in 9
whitefly populations from both Middle East Asia Minor I (MEAM1,
formerly known as B biotype) and Mediterranean (MED, formerly
known as Q biotype) species. We analysed our proteomic results on
the basis of the different TYLCV transmission abilities of the
various populations included in the study. The results provide
the first comprehensive list of candidate insect and bacterial
symbiont (mainly Rickettsia) proteins associated with virus
transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the
proteomic signatures of better vector populations differ
considerably when compared with less efficient vector populations
in the 2 whitefly species tested in this study. While MEAM1
efficient vector populations have a more lenient immune system,
the Q efficient vector populations have higher abundance of
proteins possibly implicated in virus passage through cells. Both
species show a strong link of the facultative symbiont Rickettsia
to virus transmission.},
