abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Many plant viruses are vector-borne and depend on arthropods
  for transmission between host plants. Begomoviruses, the largest, most damaging
  and emerging group of plant viruses, infect hundreds of plant species, and new virus
  species of the group are discovered each year. Begomoviruses are transmitted by
  members of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci species complex in a persistent-circulative
  manner. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is one of the most devastating begomoviruses
  worldwide and causes major losses in tomato crops, as well as in many agriculturally
  important plant species. Different B. tabaci populations vary in their virus transmission
  abilities; however, the causes for these variations are attributed among others
  to genetic differences among vector populations, as well as to differences in the
  bacterial symbionts housed within B. tabaci. RESULTS: Here, we performed discovery
  proteomic analyses in 9 whitefly populations from both Middle East Asia Minor I
  (MEAM1, formerly known as B biotype) and Mediterranean (MED, formerly known as Q
  biotype) species. We analysed our proteomic results on the basis of the different
  TYLCV transmission abilities of the various populations included in the study. The
  results provide the first comprehensive list of candidate insect and bacterial symbiont
  (mainly Rickettsia) proteins associated with virus transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  data demonstrate that the proteomic signatures of better vector populations differ
  considerably when compared with less efficient vector populations in the 2 whitefly
  species tested in this study. While MEAM1 efficient vector populations have a more
  lenient immune system, the Q efficient vector populations have higher abundance
  of proteins possibly implicated in virus passage through cells. Both species show
  a strong link of the facultative symbiont Rickettsia to virus transmission.'
