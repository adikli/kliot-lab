              resistance by constitutive overexpression of detoxification

              are costly and may affect reproduction, impair dispersal ability

               persistent inbreeding with occasional outbreeding, and the
               decision of the individual regarding whether to stay in the
               natal group and inbreed or to disperse, with the potential to
               outbreed, is flexible and may depend on social, genetic and
               ecological benefits and costs. Few of these factors have been
               investigated experimentally in these systems. The beetle
               Coccotrypes dactyliperda Fabricius, 1801 (Scolytidae:
               Xyloborinae) lives in extended family colonies inside date
               seeds. The beetles inbreed, but some individuals disperse away
               from the natal seed and may outbreed. We investigated dispersal
               behaviour and assessed fitness-related measures in inbred and
               outbred offspring, in addition to the relative abundance of two
               endosymbionts. We predicted inbred offspring to have higher
               fitness-related measures and a reduced tendency to disperse than
               outbred offspring, owing to fitness benefits of cooperation
               within the colony, whereas increased endosymbiont abundance will
               promote dispersal of their hosts, thus enhancing their own
               spread in the population. Dispersing beetles were more active
               than ones that remained in the natal seed. As predicted, fewer
               inbred offspring dispersed than outbred offspring, but they
               matured and dispersed earlier. Fitness-related measures of
               inbred mothers were either lower (number of offspring) or not
               different (body mass) from those of outbred mothers. Inbred
               dispersers had greater amounts of Wolbachia, suggesting a role
               in dispersal. The results support the hypothesis that inbred
               females reduce dispersal and that early maturation and dispersal

              arthropods for transmission between host plants. Begomoviruses,
              the largest, most damaging and emerging group of plant viruses,
              infect hundreds of plant species, and new virus species of the
              group are discovered each year. Begomoviruses are transmitted by
              members of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci species complex in a
              persistent-circulative manner. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
              (TYLCV) is one of the most devastating begomoviruses worldwide
              and causes major losses in tomato crops, as well as in many
              agriculturally important plant species. Different B. tabaci
              populations vary in their virus transmission abilities; however,
              the causes for these variations are attributed among others to
              genetic differences among vector populations, as well as to
              differences in the bacterial symbionts housed within B. tabaci.
              RESULTS: Here, we performed discovery proteomic analyses in 9
              whitefly populations from both Middle East Asia Minor I (MEAM1,
              formerly known as B biotype) and Mediterranean (MED, formerly
              known as Q biotype) species. We analysed our proteomic results on
              the basis of the different TYLCV transmission abilities of the
              various populations included in the study. The results provide
              the first comprehensive list of candidate insect and bacterial
              symbiont (mainly Rickettsia) proteins associated with virus
              transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the
              proteomic signatures of better vector populations differ
              considerably when compared with less efficient vector populations
              in the 2 whitefly species tested in this study. While MEAM1
              efficient vector populations have a more lenient immune system,
              the Q efficient vector populations have higher abundance of
              proteins possibly implicated in virus passage through cells. Both
              species show a strong link of the facultative symbiont Rickettsia

              Rickettsia spp., a facultative endosymbiont of whiteflies,
              altered TYLCV-B. tabaci interactions. A B. tabaci strain infected
              with Rickettsia acquired more TYLCV from infected plants,
              retained the virus longer, and exhibited nearly double the
              transmission efficiency compared to an uninfected B. tabaci
              strain with the same genetic background. Temporal and spatial
              antagonistic relationships were discovered between Rickettsia and
              TYLCV within the whitefly. In different time course experiments,
              the levels of virus and Rickettsia within the insect were
              inversely correlated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis
              of Rickettsia-infected midguts provided evidence for niche
              exclusion between Rickettsia and TYLCV. In particular, high
              levels of the bacterium in the midgut resulted in higher virus
              concentrations in the filter chamber, a favored site for virus
              translocation along the transmission pathway, whereas low levels
              of Rickettsia in the midgut resulted in an even distribution of
              the virus. Taken together, these results indicate that
              Rickettsia, by infecting the midgut, increases TYLCV transmission
              efficacy, adding further insights into the complex association
              between persistent plant viruses, their insect vectors, and
              microorganism tenants that reside within these insects.
              IMPORTANCE: Interest in bacterial endosymbionts in arthropods and
              many aspects of their host biology in agricultural and human
              health systems has been increasing. A recent and relevant studied
              example is the influence of Wolbachia on dengue virus
              transmission by mosquitoes. In parallel with our recently studied
              whitefly-Rickettsia-TYLCV system, other studies have shown that
              dengue virus levels in the mosquito vector are inversely
              correlated with bacterial load. Our work here presents evidence
              of unifying principles between vectors of plant and animal
              viruses in a role for endosymbionts in manipulating vector
              biology and pathogen transmission. Our results demonstrate the
              influence of an interesting and prominent bacterial endosymbiont
              in Bemisia tabaci in TYLCV transmission, a worldwide disease
              infecting tomatoes. Besides its agricultural importance, this

               provide barriers to host-range expansion by generalist
               herbivores. Nicotine is one of the most abundant and toxic plant
               secondary metabolites in nature and is defined by high toxicity
               to plant-feeding insects. There is significant variation in
               nicotine tolerance among Bemisia tabaci (tobacco whitefly)
               isolates. Some nicotine-tolerant B. tabaci strains can consume
               40-fold higher nicotine levels than susceptible strains, and
               also show cross-resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides. In
               this study, biological and molecular assays were used to
               investigate the responses of B. tabaci strains that differ in
               their ability to tolerate dietary nicotine. RESULTS: Egg laying
               and honeydew secretion bioassays as well as gene expression
               microarrays were used to measure B. tabaci biological parameters
               and gene transcripts misregulated in response to nicotine in
               resistant and susceptible strains. The resistant B. tabaci
               strain laid significantly fewer eggs and excreted more honeydew
               on a tobacco strain with high levels of nicotine, suggesting a
               fitness cost effect. The molecular response was drastic in the
               susceptible strain, while the resistant strain exhibited
               moderate response. Higher expression of the previously
               identified CYP6CM1 P450 monooxygenase gene related to the
               resistance to neonicotinoids, as well as other P450s and
               metabolic genes, was identified in the resistant and susceptible
               strains after exposure to nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine is a
               very toxic plant natural compound, and its mode of action
               resembles that of synthetic neonicotinoids. The biological and
               molecular responses observed in this study suggest that nicotine
               may play an important role in providing barriers for host-plant
               expansion by generalists, and may act as a natural factor that

               environment, and, in many cases for insect pests to agriculture,
               those factors include toxic chemical insecticides. Coping with
               the toxicity of insecticides can be costly and requires energy
               and resource allocation for adaptation and survival. Several
               behavioural, physiological and genetic mechanisms are used by
               insects to handle toxic insecticides, sometimes leading to
               resistance by constitutive overexpression of detoxification
               enzymes or inducing mutations in the target sites. Such actions
               are costly and may affect reproduction, impair dispersal ability
               and have several other effects on the insect's fitness. Fitness
               costs resulting from resistance to insecticides has been
               reported in many insects from different orders, and several
               examples are given in this mini-review.",
