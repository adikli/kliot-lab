abstract: 'UNLABELLED: Numerous animal and plant viruses are transmitted by arthropod
  vectors in a persistent, circulative manner. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV)
  is transmitted by the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci. We report here that
  infection with Rickettsia spp., a facultative endosymbiont of whiteflies, altered
  TYLCV-B. tabaci interactions. A B. tabaci strain infected with Rickettsia acquired
  more TYLCV from infected plants, retained the virus longer, and exhibited nearly
  double the transmission efficiency compared to an uninfected B. tabaci strain with
  the same genetic background. Temporal and spatial antagonistic relationships were
  discovered between Rickettsia and TYLCV within the whitefly. In different time course
  experiments, the levels of virus and Rickettsia within the insect were inversely
  correlated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of Rickettsia-infected midguts
  provided evidence for niche exclusion between Rickettsia and TYLCV. In particular,
  high levels of the bacterium in the midgut resulted in higher virus concentrations
  in the filter chamber, a favored site for virus translocation along the transmission
  pathway, whereas low levels of Rickettsia in the midgut resulted in an even distribution
  of the virus. Taken together, these results indicate that Rickettsia, by infecting
  the midgut, increases TYLCV transmission efficacy, adding further insights into
  the complex association between persistent plant viruses, their insect vectors,
  and microorganism tenants that reside within these insects. IMPORTANCE: Interest
  in bacterial endosymbionts in arthropods and many aspects of their host biology
  in agricultural and human health systems has been increasing. A recent and relevant
  studied example is the influence of Wolbachia on dengue virus transmission by mosquitoes.
  In parallel with our recently studied whitefly-Rickettsia-TYLCV system, other studies
  have shown that dengue virus levels in the mosquito vector are inversely correlated
  with bacterial load. Our work here presents evidence of unifying principles between
  vectors of plant and animal viruses in a role for endosymbionts in manipulating
  vector biology and pathogen transmission. Our results demonstrate the influence
  of an interesting and prominent bacterial endosymbiont in Bemisia tabaci in TYLCV
  transmission, a worldwide disease infecting tomatoes. Besides its agricultural importance,
  this system provides interesting insights into Bemisia interaction with these newly
  discovered endosymbionts.'
