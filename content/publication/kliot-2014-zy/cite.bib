 abstract = {UNLABELLED: Numerous animal and plant viruses are transmitted by
arthropod vectors in a persistent, circulative manner. Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is transmitted by the sweet potato
whitefly Bemisia tabaci. We report here that infection with
Rickettsia spp., a facultative endosymbiont of whiteflies,
altered TYLCV-B. tabaci interactions. A B. tabaci strain infected
with Rickettsia acquired more TYLCV from infected plants,
retained the virus longer, and exhibited nearly double the
transmission efficiency compared to an uninfected B. tabaci
strain with the same genetic background. Temporal and spatial
antagonistic relationships were discovered between Rickettsia and
TYLCV within the whitefly. In different time course experiments,
the levels of virus and Rickettsia within the insect were
inversely correlated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis
of Rickettsia-infected midguts provided evidence for niche
exclusion between Rickettsia and TYLCV. In particular, high
levels of the bacterium in the midgut resulted in higher virus
concentrations in the filter chamber, a favored site for virus
translocation along the transmission pathway, whereas low levels
of Rickettsia in the midgut resulted in an even distribution of
the virus. Taken together, these results indicate that
Rickettsia, by infecting the midgut, increases TYLCV transmission
efficacy, adding further insights into the complex association
between persistent plant viruses, their insect vectors, and
microorganism tenants that reside within these insects.
IMPORTANCE: Interest in bacterial endosymbionts in arthropods and
many aspects of their host biology in agricultural and human
health systems has been increasing. A recent and relevant studied
example is the influence of Wolbachia on dengue virus
transmission by mosquitoes. In parallel with our recently studied
whitefly-Rickettsia-TYLCV system, other studies have shown that
dengue virus levels in the mosquito vector are inversely
correlated with bacterial load. Our work here presents evidence
of unifying principles between vectors of plant and animal
viruses in a role for endosymbionts in manipulating vector
biology and pathogen transmission. Our results demonstrate the
influence of an interesting and prominent bacterial endosymbiont
in Bemisia tabaci in TYLCV transmission, a worldwide disease
infecting tomatoes. Besides its agricultural importance, this
system provides interesting insights into Bemisia interaction
with these newly discovered endosymbionts.},
